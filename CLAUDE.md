## What This Business Does

**Tagline:** "The Coach Who Won't Tell You to Quit Your 9-to-5"

**Positioning:** Build an offer so clear it sells without a sales call — in one afternoon.

## Content Rule

**All content — posts, newsletters, threads, carousels — must pull from `reference/domain/content-ideas.md` as the primary source.** This file contains ideas validated against offer.md, audience.md, voice.md, main-angles.md, and content-strategy.md. No off-message content. If an idea isn't in the library, check it against all 5 reference files before drafting.
